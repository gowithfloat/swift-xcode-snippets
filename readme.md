# Swift Xcode Snippets [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gowithfloat/swift-xcode-snippets.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/gowithfloat/swift-xcode-snippets)

A collection of useful Xcode snippets for working with Swift.

# About

Installing the `.codesnippet` files is easy; just place them in `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets/` and Xcode will recognize them. You can view all code snippets by opening the right-hand Utilities pane in Xcode and then selecting the "Show the Code Snippet library" button (the curly braces) at the bottom.

When defining a code snippet, you can use `<#PlaceholderText#>` to generate placeholders. You will then be able to tab between these placeholders after placing the snippet.

# Completion Shortcuts

Once these code snippets are installed, you can type the following commands to bring up code snippets in autocomplete.

* `doc`: Generates [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) compatible documentation for a single method. Options include a number of parameter/return combinations.
